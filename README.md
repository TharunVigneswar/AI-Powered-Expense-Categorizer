# AI Powered Expense Categorizer

### Overview:

This project is a web-based expense management tool that automatically categorizes transactions using AI-based keyword matching. It helps users track expenses, import/export data, and visualize spending through a pie chart.

### Key Features:

âœ… AI-Based Categorization: Automatically assigns categories to expenses based on descriptions (e.g., "Pizza" â†’ "Food").

âœ… Dynamic Expense Table: Users can add, edit, and delete expenses.

âœ… CSV & Excel Support: Import expenses from CSV/Excel files and export categorized data in a properly formatted Excel sheet.

âœ… Real-Time Pie Chart: Displays a visual breakdown of expenses.

âœ… Smart Keyword Matching: Recognizes similar terms (e.g., "Movie" â†’ "Entertainment").

### Technology Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Data Visualization: Chart.js (for pie chart)

File Handling: XLSX.js (for Excel import/export)

AI Model: Pre-trained dataset of 200+ keywords for category prediction

### How It Works:

User adds an expense (amount + description).

AI predicts the category using a keyword database.

Expense is added to the table and stored.

Pie chart updates in real-time to show spending distribution.

Users can import/export data via CSV/Excel.

### Future Improvements:

ðŸš€ Machine Learning Model for improved AI predictions

ðŸš€ User-Defined Categories for customization

ðŸš€ Cloud Storage Integration to save expenses online

ðŸš€ Better UI/UX Design with a mobile-friendly layout
